🔍 AI-Powered Deepfake & Image Detection

A browser extension + web app that detects manipulated images and videos online using AI.
This tool helps users identify AI-generated or deepfake content, explains why it’s flagged, and provides community-powered verification for greater trust.

✨ Features

🖼️ Right-Click Detection – Detect fake images directly from the browser context menu.

🎥 Video Link Analysis – Paste video links to check for audio-visual mismatches & manipulation.

📊 Confidence Score + Explanation – Example: “85% likely manipulated – lighting mismatch detected.”

🌍 Reverse Lookup – Attempts to find the original image/video for comparison.

👥 Community Verification Layer – Users can flag or vote on suspicious content → improves detection over time.

🧠 Explainability – Highlights pixel-level inconsistencies, lighting issues, or metadata tampering.
